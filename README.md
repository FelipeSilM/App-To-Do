## Overview

### The challenge

A simple solution for a task app. My first solo project. Here the user will be able to write his tasks, mark those that are already completed and delete the tasks he wants! 

### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Actually i won't go update this project for a while, cause i'm working in another ones. But I have ideas for it, like: 

- improve the code (always)
- add a background image what will make the user able to switch for others
- save the changes in some database
